This is a reusable java library to create simple text-based games, like the game Zork!

Here's a little backstory.  So, my 10 year old daughter is getting into programming, like her dear old dad.  She's been playing with Scratch (http://scratch.mit.edu/) for quite a while now, and is really good at it!  But now she wants to go to the next step.  She says to me "Daddy, I want to do 'codes' like you".  (how cute is that!)

So, since I have the whole family on Linux, I thought Java would be a good language to introduce her to.  I started with Hello World and a Number Guessing game, but I knew I needed something easy that would keep her attention.  Then I remembered that when I was her age, I played games like Zork!  So, I goggled a bit for some source code for a Zork clone, but came up empty.  I then decided to spend a couple afternoons getting a Zork library put together for her to quickly be able to create some games and get some immediate satisfaction.

I welcome anybody who wants to expand on this project.  The source contains a single, example game to illustrate how to create a game using the engine.
